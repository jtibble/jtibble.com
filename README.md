My Personal Site


I'm building this site as a way for me to build my JavaScript and CSS knowledge, while applying what I've learned through my job.

Iteration 1 (2013/14): RequireJS + Backbone + Bootstrap 2.3.2

Iteration 2 (2015): AngularJS + Bootstrap 3.X


To Run:

Clone the repository locally. From the root, run bower install to get all the dependencies. Host the project using apache or node's static-server library, and then open up localhost and the correct port in your browser.

Thanks!
