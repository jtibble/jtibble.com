My Personal Site


I'm building this site as a way for me to build my JavaScript and CSS knowledge, while applying what I've learned through my job. 


To Run:

Clone the repository or download the code from a release, and then host index.html in your favorite webserver. I like to use the Brackets editor (www.brackets.io), and run the page live.
If you try to run the page locally without hosting, the XHR require.js text-plugin calls will fail.

You can see the current work-in-progress site by going to http://jtibble.com
